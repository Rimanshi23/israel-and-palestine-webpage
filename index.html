                  Prior to World War 1, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, home to Arab Muslims, Arab Christians and Jewish Communities.
                  After World War 1, the League of Nations mandated Britain to govern Palestine.
                  This led to an increase in Jewish immigration, which fueled tentions between Jewish settlers and the Arab Palestinian population.
                  Eventually, due to challenges in governing colonies after the war, Palestine was handed over to the United Nations. 
                  The Balfour Declaration of 1917 expressed support for a Jewish national home in Palestine.
                  In 1947, the United Nations partition plan recommended separate Jewish and Arab states, accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders. 
                  This set the stage for the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the establishment of Israel, which continues to impact the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and regional dynamics even today.

                        In early October 2023, war broke out between Israel and Hamas, the militant Islamist group that has controlled Gaza since 2006. 
                        Hamas fighters fired rockets into Israel and stormed southern Israeli cities and towns across the border of the Gaza strip, killing and injuring hundreds of soldiers and civilians and taking dozens of hostages. 
                        The attack took Israel by surprise, though the state quickly mounted a deadly retaliatory operation. 
                        One day after the October 7 attack, the Israeli cabinet formally declared war against Hamas, followed by a directive from the defense minister to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to carry out a â€œcomplete seige" of Gaza.

                            Following the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas on October 7, 2023, President Joe Biden made a strong statement of support for Israel. 
                            On the same day that Israel declared war against the terrorist group, the United States announced that it would send renewed shipments of arms and move its Mediterranean Sea warships closer to Israel.

                        The Israeli Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements among the Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.
                        The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.
                        The collision between those two movements in southern Levant upon the emergence of Palestinian nationalism after the Franco-Syrian War in the 1920s escalated into the Sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine in 1930s and 1940s, and expanded into the wider Arab Israeli conflict later on.

                        One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants. 
                        Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace process. 
                        Support among Palestinians for Hamas is considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and violence remains a threat, security becomes a prime concern for many Israelis. 
                        The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.
